## Git/GitHub Instructions

- This paragraph will make sense **after you read the GIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md page**:
    - Make sure to do a ```git pull``` on the developer branch any time you want to see the most up-to-date developer branch or when you are about to branch out from the developer branch to add a new function/change. This is important because the remote developer branch might have updated while you were gone, working on another feature, or when you accept your own pull request. Yes, you could do a ```git pull``` for other branches.

- Team, please refer to [**GIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**](GIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for instructions on setting up and using our Git + GitHub repository.
